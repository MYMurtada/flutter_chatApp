# flutter_chatApp

Welcome to the first flutter-firebase app for me.

I am thrilled to introduce the app to you so buckle up and let's start...


Introdction:

The app uses Firebase database to create an online platform for charters to chat.

The app can identify if the user has access to the messages and if not a registration option is available.

Currently, the app is a single chat page app that combine all the users to chat in one place ( maybe in the future I will develop the app to let it create private chats between users ).
